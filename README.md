# CrazyRunnerV2-Scripts
Scripts for my infinite 3D runner (2nd completed solo project). These are available for portfolio and educational purposes.

# Development Timeline
April 2024 - July 2024
Note: this was technically my first solo project, but my skills were not at the level to where I was able to complete it (scope was too big for my 
skill level) so I pivoted to Roll-A-Ball, and once I completed that came back to Crazy Runner and was able to finish it.

# Development Reflection
Crazy Runner was my attempt at building a larger, systems-driven game after finishing Roll-A-Ball. I took the things I learned from completing
my first project and applied them to this project (scene management, programming fundamentals, collisions, movement) but also implemented a
lot more features that I was completely unfamiliar with: in-game currency that the player collects while playing the game, an in-game shop the
player can use to purchase skins and cheats using the in-game currency, a procedurally generated obstacle system, where the obstacles spawned randomly,
but the generation logic was designed to always remain fair and ensure the player never enountered on obstacle layout that was impossible to pass, and 
finally a file-save system that tracked player stats such as total games played, farthest distance, highest score, as well as keeping track of which
items the player has purchased and how many gems they have (the in-game currency). Working through these systems helped me understand how to manage
game states, structure data, and design gameplay loops that tie multiple moving parts together.

I still used free assets for most of the visuals, but this allowed me to focus almost entirely on gameplay programming, testing, and system design. I
did experiment with a small amount of 3D modeling, but the biggest part of this project was definitely the programming aspect.
